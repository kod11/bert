        "If you’ve been following Natural Language Processing over the past year, you’ve probably heard of BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

In an existing pipeline, BERT can replace text embedding layers like ELMO and GloVE. Alternatively, [finetuning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Fine_tuning) BERT can provide both an accuracy boost and faster training time in many cases.\n",
